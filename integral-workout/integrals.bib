abstract = {A formalism is developed which allows overlap, kinetic energy, potential energy, and electron repulsion integrals over cartesian Gaussian functions to be expressed in a very compact form involving easily computed auxiliary functions. Similar formulas involving the same auxiliary functions are given for the common charge moments, electric-field operators, and spin-interaction operators. Recursion relations are given for the auxiliary functions which make possible the use of Gaussian functions of arbitrarily large angular momentum. An algorithm is described for the computation of electron repulsion integrals.}

abstract = {Abstract A synthesis of certain of the features of the recently developed HGP method of Head-Gordon and Pople with some of the constructs of the well-established McMurchie-Davidson (MD) scheme has led to the development of a new algorithm for the computation of the two-electron repulsion integrals which arise in conventional ab initio quantum chemical calculations using Gaussian basis sets. As in the MD scheme, derivatives of the two-electron integrals with respect to the nuclear coordinates are obtained very efficiently by the new algorithm. Moreover, in the spirit of the HGP approach, as much of the computational effort as possible is performed outside the contraction loops. This is achieved through the intermediacy of scaled, partially contracted integral sets and through the use of a near-optimal solution to the central tree-search problem. Explicit FLOP (floating point operation) counts suggest that the new algorithm is typically a factor of 2 cheaper than the HGP method for contracted basis sets.},
